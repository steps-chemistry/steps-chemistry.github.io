# PLACEHOLDER Quadratic Functions Practice

<span class="exercise-number">1</span>

## Problem Set A: Vertex Form

Convert each quadratic function to vertex form and identify the vertex.

**1.1** $f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 5$

**1.2** $g(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 3$

**1.3** $h(x) = -x^2 + 4x - 1$

## Problem Set B: Graphing

For each function, find:
- Vertex
- Axis of symmetry
- y-intercept
- x-intercepts (if they exist)

**2.1** $f(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 4$

**2.2** $g(x) = -2(x + 1)^2 + 8$

## Problem Set C: Applications

**3.1** A ball is thrown upward from a height of 6 feet. Its height $h$ (in feet) after $t$ seconds is given by:
$$h(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 6$$

a) What is the maximum height reached by the ball?
b) When does the ball reach its maximum height?
c) When does the ball hit the ground?

**3.2** A rectangular garden has a perimeter of 60 feet. Express the area as a function of the width, then find the dimensions that give the maximum area.

## Problem Set D: Challenge Problems

**4.1** Find the equation of the parabola that passes through the points $(1, 4)$, $(2, 1)$, and $(3, 2)$.

**4.2** A quadratic function has vertex $(-2, 5)$ and passes through the point $(0, 1)$. Find the equation of the function.

## Working Through Solutions

### Hints for Problem Set A:
- Complete the square: $x^2 + bx = (x + \frac{b}{2})^2 - (\frac{b}{2})^2$
- For $ax^2 + bx + c$, first factor out $a$ from the first two terms

### Hints for Problem Set C:
- For projectile motion, the vertex gives the maximum height
- The ball hits the ground when $h(t) = 0$
- For optimization problems, express one variable in terms of another using constraints

## Class Discussion Questions

1. How does the coefficient $a$ in $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ affect the shape of the parabola?

2. Why is vertex form $f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$ useful for graphing?

3. In real-world applications, what does the vertex typically represent?
