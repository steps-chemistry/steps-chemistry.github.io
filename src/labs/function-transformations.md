# Lab: PLACEHOLDER Exploring Function Transformations

## Objective
Discover how different parameters transform the graphs of functions through systematic exploration and pattern recognition.

## Materials Needed
- Graphing calculator or computer with graphing software
- Graph paper
- Colored pencils or pens

## Part 1: The Parent Function
**Time: 10 minutes**

Start with the parent function $f(x) = x^2$.

1. **Graph** $f(x) = x^2$ and record key features:
   - Vertex: ______
   - Axis of symmetry: ______
   - Direction of opening: ______

2. **Create a data table** with at least 7 points:

| x | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| f(x) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Part 2: Vertical Transformations
**Time: 15 minutes**

### Investigation A: Adding Constants

Graph these functions on the same coordinate system:
- $g_1(x) = x^2 + 3$
- $g_2(x) = x^2 - 2$
- $g_3(x) = x^2 + 5$

**Observations:**
1. How do these graphs compare to $f(x) = x^2$?

2. What happens to the vertex of each function?

3. **Make a conjecture**: If $h(x) = x^2 + k$, what happens when:
   - $k > 0$? ________________
   - $k < 0$? ________________

### Investigation B: Multiplying by Constants

Graph these functions:
- $p_1(x) = 2x^2$
- $p_2(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2$
- $p_3(x) = -x^2$

**Observations:**
1. How does the shape change when you multiply by a number greater than 1?

2. What happens when you multiply by a number between 0 and 1?

3. What happens when you multiply by a negative number?

4. **Make a conjecture**: For $j(x) = ax^2$, what effect does $a$ have?

## Part 3: Horizontal Transformations
**Time: 15 minutes**

### Investigation C: Inside the Function

Graph these functions:
- $r_1(x) = (x - 2)^2$
- $r_2(x) = (x + 3)^2$
- $r_3(x) = (x - 1)^2$

**Observations:**
1. Where is the vertex of each function?

2. **Counterintuitive discovery**: When we have $(x - 2)^2$, which direction does the graph move?

3. **Make a conjecture**: For $s(x) = (x - h)^2$, what happens when:
   - $h > 0$? ________________
   - $h < 0$? ________________

## Part 4: Combining Transformations
**Time: 10-15 minutes**

Now let's combine what we've learned!

### Challenge Problems

For each function, **predict** the transformations before graphing:

**4.1** $f(x) = 2(x - 1)^2 + 3$
- Prediction: ________________________________
- After graphing: ____________________________

**4.2** $g(x) = -\frac{1}{2}(x + 2)^2 - 1$
- Prediction: ________________________________
- After graphing: ____________________________

**4.3** Design your own function with these transformations:
- Reflected over x-axis
- Moved right 4 units
- Moved up 2 units
- Vertically compressed by factor of $\frac{1}{3}$

Your function: $h(x) = $ _______________________

## Part 5: Real-World Application
**Time: 5 minutes**

A basketball follows the path $h(t) = -16(t - 1.5)^2 + 36$, where $h$ is height in feet and $t$ is time in seconds.

1. **Without graphing**, determine:
   - Maximum height: _____ feet
   - Time of maximum height: _____ seconds
   - How long until the ball hits the ground: _____ seconds

2. **Verify** by graphing and explain how the transformations help you understand the real situation.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Write the general form for a transformed quadratic:
   $$f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$$
   
   Explain what each parameter does:
   - $a$: ________________________________
   - $h$: ________________________________
   - $k$: ________________________________

2. **Counterintuitive Insight**: Why does $(x - 3)^2$ move the graph right instead of left?

3. **Extension**: How might these transformation rules apply to other parent functions like $\sqrt{x}$, $|x|$, or $\frac{1}{x}$?

## Lab Report

Write a brief summary (2-3 paragraphs) explaining:
- The most surprising discovery you made
- How transformations can help solve real-world problems
- One question you still have about function transformations

## Take-Home Challenge

Explore transformations with a different parent function of your choice. Create your own mini-investigation and present your findings to the class next session.
